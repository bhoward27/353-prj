    relevant-amenities is exactly what it soundsl like (but with
    certain columns not present, like tags). cities.csv is intended
    to be a file with the records categorized by city *with* all the
    relevant amenities (only).

    Fix code to assign squares/boxes to records.
    
    Code added in previous commit does not work. Add records.csv,
    which has the current code run on only first hundred records
    (it was for testing purposes). Now I'm running the real deal.
    Still slow as heck obviously. Problem with previous commit was
    that it did NOTHING--the csv file did not have the desired
    columns. Also, I have adopted a better approach. Instead of
    adding the latitudes and longitudes to df, you just add a column
    called box id, which corresponds to the id of an entry in the
    boundaries df.

    Add code.py, which tries to assign squares to the records.
    
    It's extremely slow. I put it in .py file so that I could have it
    output it's progress as it goes. It will probably take about 40
    minutes to run. Haven't reached the end yet.

    the code from code.py with it. Heatmaps work, but not as desired,
